#Documentation and Reporting
 Our report deliverable  should consist of the following:

 * An attack chain detailing steps taken to achieve compromise.
 * A strong executive summary that a non-technical audience can understand.
 * Detailed findings specific to the client's environment that include a risk rating, finding impact, remediation recommendations, and high-quality external 
   references related to the issue.
 * Adequate steps to reproduce each finding so the team responsible for remediation can understand and test the issue while putting fixes in place.
 * Near, medium, and long-term recommendations specific to the environment.
 * Appendices which include information such as the target scope, OSINT data, password cracking analysis , discovered 
   ports/services, compromised hosts, compromised accounts, files transferred to client-owned systems, any account creation/system modifications, an Active 
   Directory security analysis , relevant scan data/supplementary documentation, and any other information necessary to explain a specific finding or 
   recommendation further.

At this stage, we will create a draft report that is the first deliverable our client will receive.

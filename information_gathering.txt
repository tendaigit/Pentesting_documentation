#Information gathering

This is the phase in which we gather all available information about the company, its employees and infrastructure, and how they are organized.
  Information gathering is the most frequent and vital phase throughout the penetration testing process, to which we will return again and again.

We can obtain the necessary information relevant to us in many different ways. However, we can divide them into the following categories:
 * Open-Source Intelligence
 * Infrastructure Enumeration
 * Service Enumeration
 * Host Enumeration

#Open-Source Intelligence
 OSINT is a process for finding publicly available information on a target company or individuals that allows the identification of events.

#Infrastructure Enumeration
 During the infrastructure enumeration, we try to overview the company's position on the internet and intranet.
 For this, we use OSINT and the first active scans. We use services such as DNS to create a map of the client's servers and hosts and develop an understanding of 
 how their infrastructure is structured. 

#Service Enumeration
 In service enumeration, we identify services that allow us to interact with the host or server over the network.
 it is crucial to find out about the service, what version it is, what information it provides us, and the reason it can be used.

#Host Enumeration
 We try to identify which operating system is running on the host or server, which services it uses, which versions of the services, and much more. 
 apart from the active scans, we can also use various OSINT methods to tell us how this host or server may be configured.

#Pillaging
  After hitting the Post-Exploitation stage, pillaging is performed to collect sensitive information locally on the already exploited host, such as employee 
  names, customer data, and much more.

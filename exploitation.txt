#Prioritization of Possible Attacks
 Once we have found one or two vulnerabilities during the Vulnerability Assessment stage that we can apply to our target network/system, 
 we can prioritize those  based on:

 * Probability of Success: executing a particular attack against the target. CVSS Scoring can help us here, using the NVD calculator.
 * Complexity
 * Probability of Damage

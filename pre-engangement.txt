#Pre-engagement is the stage of preparation for the actual penetration test.

The entire pre-engagement process consists of three essential components:

1. Scoping questionnaire

2. Pre-engagement meeting

3. Kick-off meeting

#Scoping Questionnaire

  The scoping questionnaire should clearly explain our services and may typically ask them to choose one or more from the following list:

    1. Internal Vulnerability Assessment
    2. External Vulnerability Assessment
    3. Internal Penetration Test
    4. External Penetration Test
    5. Wireless Security Assessment
    6. Application Security Assessment
    7. Physical Security Assessment
    8. Social Engineering Assessment
    9. Red Team Assessment
    10.Web Application Security Assessment

#Pre-Engagement Meeting

This meeting discusses all relevant and essential components with the customer before the penetration test.

##Contract - Checklist

☐ NDA

☐ Goals: Goals are milestones that must be achieved during the order/project.

☐ Scope: The individual components to be tested are discussed and defined.
         These may include domains, IP ranges, individual hosts, specific accounts, security systems.

☐ Penetration Testing Type

☐ Methodologies: Examples: OSSTMM, OWASP, automated and manual unauthenticated analysis of the internal and external network components,
                 vulnerability assessments of network components and web applications, vulnerability threat vectorization, verification
                 and exploitation, and exploit development to facilitate evasion techniques.

☐ Penetration Testing Locations

☐ Time Estimation

☐ Third Parties: it must be determined via which third-party providers our customer obtains services.
                 These can be cloud providers, ISPs, and other hosting providers.

☐ Evasive Testing: Evasive testing is the test of evading and passing security traffic and security systems in the customer's infrastructure

☐ Risks: We must also inform our client about the risks involved in the tests and the possible consequences.

☐ Scope Limitations & Restrictions

☐ Information Handling

☐ Contact Information

☐ Lines of Communication

☐ Reporting

☐ Payment Terms

Based on the Contract Checklist and the input information shared in scoping, the Penetration Testing Proposal (Contract) and the associated
Rules of Engagement (RoE) are created.

#Kick-Off Meeting
This meeting usually includes client POC(s) (from Internal Audit, Information Security, IT, Governance & Risk, etc., depending on the client),
client technical support staff (developers, sysadmins, network engineers, etc.), and the penetration testing team

We will go over the nature of the penetration test and how it will take place.

We also explain that if a critical vulnerability is identified, penetration testing activities will be paused, a vulnerability notification
report will be generated, and the emergency contacts will be contacted.

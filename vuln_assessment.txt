#Vulnerability Assessment
 we examine and analyze the information gathered during the information gathering phase.
 An analysis is a detailed examination of an event or process, describing its origin and impact, that with the help of certain precautions and actions, 
 can be triggered to support or prevent future occurrences.

There are four different types of analysis:
 * Descriptive:  it describes a data set based on individual characteristics.
 * Diagnostic:  clarifies conditions' causes, effects, and interactions. Doing so provides insights that are obtained through correlations and interpretation. 
 * Predictive:  By evaluating historical and current data, predictive analysis creates a predictive model for future probabilities. 
 * Prescriptive:  Prescriptive analytics aims to narrow down what actions to take to eliminate or prevent a future problem or trigger a specific activity or 
                  process.

#Vulnerability Research and Analysis
   we look for known vulnerabilities, exploits, and security holes that have already been discovered and reported.
   if we have identified a version of a service or application through information gathering and found a Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE), it is very 
   likely that this vulnerability is still present.

   We can find vulnerability disclosures for each component using many different sources. These include:
      *CVEdetails	  *Exploit DB	      *Vulners
      *Packet Storm Security	         *NIST
This is where Diagnostic Analysis and Predictive Analysis is used.

#Assessment of Possible Attack Vectors
 Vulnerability Assessment also includes the actual testing, which is part of Predictive Analysis.

#The Return
 Suppose we are unable to detect or identify potential vulnerabilities from our analysis. In that case, we will return to the Information Gathering stage and look 
 for more in-depth information than we have gathered so far.
